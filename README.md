# FX-Quant-Pricing


Implementation of various methods to price FX derivative using the Black-Scholes Model can be found in `Code`.

- `BlackScholes.cpp`: Analytical solution to the Black-Scholes model.
- `FiniteDiffMethod.cpp`: Utilizes the finite difference method to solve the Black-Scholes PDE.
- `MonteCarlo.cpp`: A Monte Carlo simulation for asset prices to estimate the value of FX derivatives.
